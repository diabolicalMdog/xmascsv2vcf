This script takes a bunch of single-line records (tab-separated), does some
matching, and emits a single vcf file suitable to import as an address book
on sites like Shutterfly.

Usage:

./xmascsv2vcf.pl < christmas_dump_2013_12_12_04.txt  > xmas-2013-12-12-01.vcard

When more than one contact lives at the same address, IF the two contacts have
the same last name, it combines them.  For example, if Joe and Jane
Contactsworth live at 111 P St #31337, it will emit the following:

BEGIN:VCARD
VERSION:3.0
N:Family;The Contactsworth;;;
FN:The Contactsworth Family
ADR;type=HOME:;;111 P St #31337;Atlanta;GA;95128;
END:VCARD

If more than one contact lives at an address but they have different last
names (e.g., Foo and Bar), the script makes the following style of family name:

...
N:Family;The Foo / Bar;;;
FN:The Foo / Bar Family
...
